# Artist-Playlist-Generator

Small Side project to get playlists from Trello Cards.

The Idea is that you have a Trello Board with each Card representing an artist which you might be interested in.
The program then automatically adds the top 10 song from these artists (According to Spotify) to a Playlist.

The entire thing has a small GUI to simplify the process of choosing the correct Board.

Future Ideas involve a small scale recommendation method to help find similar artists and a graphical visualization of artists and how similar they are to each other.
